# Multi-Robot Task Distributions

## Description

The project aims to migrate a multi-robot task distribution system, originally developed using ROS1 to ROS2. The system simulates robots working collaboratively in a warehouse to fetch items based on client requests. The migration ensures compatibility with ROS2’s improved communication features and long-term support. ROS2 provides enhanced multi-robot communication, security, and real-time control features. Thus, migration is required to ensure system sustainability and to benefit from ROS2’s advanced tools.

## Features

1) The system will be able to run and simulate in ROS2, provinding a stable environment for multi-robot communication.
